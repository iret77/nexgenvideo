# Chord recognition model — selection, license, input contract

Step 0 of [#192](https://github.com/iret77/nexgenvideo/issues/192) (device-gated remainder of #191).
This is the locked decision the rest of the chord work builds on. **Do not re-litigate it without a
concrete reason** — everything downstream (the CQT frontend, the ONNX provider) is mechanical once
the model is fixed, and it is fixed here.

## Decision: BTC (Bi-directional Transformer for Chord recognition)

- Repo: [`jayg996/BTC-ISMIR19`](https://github.com/jayg996/BTC-ISMIR19), paper *A Bi-Directional
  Transformer for Musical Chord Recognition* (ISMIR 2019).
- **License: MIT** (`Copyright (c) 2019 Jonggwon Park`) — bundling, redistribution, modification and
  **commercial use** are all permitted. This clears the acceptance rule that a permissive license
  must allow bundling *or* commercial runtime download; MIT allows both.
- **Pretrained weights ship in the repo under the same MIT license** — no separate weights license to
  vet, unlike madmom (whose trained models are CC BY-NC-SA and therefore unusable in a Developer-ID
  commercial app; that is why the reference *mechanism* was ported but the *weights* had to change):
  - `test/btc_model.pt` — maj/min vocabulary (25 classes).
  - `test/btc_model_large_voca.pt` — large vocabulary (170 classes).
- Runs on CPU via onnxruntime in seconds for a 3–4 min track (8-layer transformer, hidden size 128).

### Vocabulary choice

Ship the **maj/min (25-class)** model as the default: 12 major + 12 minor + `N` (no-chord). It is the
faithful analogue of the reference pipeline's output and the label set our schema and the Python
`chord_progression` (which dropped `"N"`) already expect. The 170-class large-voca model is a drop-in
alternative (same architecture, different `output_layer` width + vocabulary) if richer labels are
wanted later — the `chord_progression` schema field is a free string, so it accommodates either.

## Input contract (derived from the preprocessing SOURCE, not docs)

All values from `run_config.yaml` and `utils/mir_eval_modules.py::audio_file_to_features` /
`test.py` in the repo — reconcile the Swift frontend against *these*, per the Beat This! lesson
(`mel_scale="slaney"` vs `norm='slaney'`): match the model's actual preprocessing code, never its prose.

| Stage | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Sample rate | 22050 Hz, mono | `run_config.mp3.song_hz`; `librosa.load(..., sr, mono=True)` |
| Segment length | 10.0 s windows, CQT'd independently then concatenated on the time axis | `mp3.inst_len`; the `while` loop in `audio_file_to_features` |
| Transform | `librosa.cqt(y, sr=22050, n_bins=144, bins_per_octave=24, hop_length=2048)` | `feature.n_bins/bins_per_octave/hop_length` |
| CQT defaults (implicit) | `fmin = C1 ≈ 32.703 Hz`, `tuning` estimated from signal, `filter_scale=1`, `norm=1`, `sparsity=0.01` | librosa defaults — **pin these explicitly in the nnAudio export config**; the `--check-parity` step is what confirms nnAudio reproduces them |
| Magnitude | `feature = log(abs(CQT) + 1e-6)` | `audio_file_to_features` |
| Layout | transpose to `[T, 144]` | `test.py:56` `feature = feature.T` |
| **Normalization** | `feature = (feature - mean) / std`, where **`mean` and `std` are scalars stored in the checkpoint** (`checkpoint['mean']`, `checkpoint['std']`) | `test.py:40-41,57` — must be exported alongside the ONNX |
| Instancing | pad `T` up to a multiple of `timestep = 108`, then feed the transformer 108 frames at a time | `test.py:59-71`, `model.timestep` |
| Frame period | `time_unit = inst_len / timestep = 10 / 108 ≈ 0.092593 s` | `test.py:58` (`feature_per_second`) |
| Output | per-frame arg-max over the 25 (or 170) classes → chord index | `test.py:71-73` |
| Labels | `idx2chord` (25) / `idx2voca_chord` (170) index→label maps | `utils/mir_eval_modules.py` |

A 10 s window at hop 2048 / 22050 Hz yields ⌈220500/2048⌉ = 108 CQT frames, so `timestep = 108`
lines up with one segment exactly.

## How this maps onto NexGenVideo

The seam and the decode tail already landed (commit `dee95fe`, #191 steps 2–3) and are faithful to
BTC's own decode:

- **`ChordDecode.segments(labels:vocabulary:hopSeconds:)`** already does BTC's exact post-processing:
  per-frame arg-max indices → merge consecutive equal labels → `[start, end)` with
  `start = runStart·time_unit`, `end = runEnd⁺¹·time_unit`, drop `N`. Call it with
  `hopSeconds = 10.0/108.0`. BTC's transformer output is already temporally smooth, so `viterbi` is
  **optional** here (use it only as a light anti-flicker pass; `transitionPenalty = 0` reproduces raw
  arg-max).
- **`AudioChordRecognizing` / `RecognizedChord`** is the provider seam; `EngineRegistry.chordRecognizer`
  is wired into the analysis phase.

### Architecture decision: the CQT front-end is baked INTO the ONNX

The one fidelity-critical piece is the CQT. Rather than re-implement librosa's CQT in Swift (the issue's
original step 4) — where it could not be verified against ground truth in a headless CI-only environment
(no `librosa`) and would be "plausible but subtly wrong", the exact `mel_scale`-vs-`norm` trap — the CQT
is **baked into the exported ONNX graph** via nnAudio (`CQT1992v2`, which follows librosa conventions).
Consequences:

- The exported model takes a **raw 10 s mono window at 22.05 kHz** and returns per-frame chord logits.
  Normalization (`(x−mean)/std`) is baked in too.
- **CQT↔librosa fidelity is verified in Python at export** (`export_btc_chord_onnx.py --check-parity`),
  the one place librosa actually runs — not hand-waved on the Swift side.
- The Swift provider shrinks to windowing + arg-max + the already-CI-tested `ChordDecode`; there is **no
  fragile DSP in Swift** to get wrong.

This trades a slightly heavier export step for the only design in which the DSP is machine-checkable
against ground truth. The maj/min pretrained weights must still work through nnAudio's CQT rather than
librosa's — the parity check (and eval on the repo's `example.mp3`, whose `.lab` is known) confirms that.

### Landed (commit for this doc)

- **`ChordRecognizer`** (`Sources/NexGenVideo/Audio/ChordRecognizer.swift`) — mirrors `BeatThisDetector`:
  `HFModelStore.ensure` the model + meta, load mono 22.05 kHz, slice into 10 s windows, run `OrtRuntime`
  per window, arg-max, then `ChordDecode.segments(hopSeconds: inst_len/timestep)`. Registered via
  `registry.registerChordRecognizer(...)`. Degrades to `nil` (→ empty, never wrong) on any failure.
- **`scripts/export_btc_chord_onnx.py`** — produces `btc_chord.onnx` (audio → logits, CQT baked in) +
  `btc_chord_meta.json` (vocabulary/geometry), with the librosa parity check.

### Remaining (single device/model step)

Run the export script on a machine with torch+nnAudio+librosa, confirm the parity check + `example.mp3`
eval, host `btc_chord.onnx` + `btc_chord_meta.json`, and set their URLs in `ChordRecognizer.swift`
(currently a placeholder — until hosted, the provider cleanly downloads-fail → no chords, pipeline
unaffected). Then validate on a real track from the built app, the same on-device loop
`BeatThisDetector` went through — CI never runs the ONNX model.
