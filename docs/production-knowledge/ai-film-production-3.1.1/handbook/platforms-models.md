## Version/evidence routing

This file preserves **model prompt profiles and historical production evidence**, not current platform UI/MCP selectors. Every production use must carry the RECEIPT line (SKILL.md Scope & version; state `live-checked <date>` or `from reference <KEY>`, SKILL rule 16).

- **Current Higgsfield UI/MCP authority:** [`platform-ui-workflows.md`](platform-ui-workflows.md), notably `HF-CS4@2026-09-04`, `HF-WEB@2026-09-04`, and `HF-MCP@2026-09-04`.
- **Historical Cinema table below:** `HF-CS3.5-HIST` — Cinema Studio **3.5** source capture; its source date is not established here. It is archival vocabulary only, never a list of current selectable 4.0 controls.
- **Live prompt patterns in ch. 13b:** version-independent Cinema Studio/Seedance patterns (multi-plate set, master-screen lock, zero-motion block, ANTI-IP block, dials-before-prompt) — current doctrine, unlike ch. 13.
- **Model profiles in ch. 21:** exact named model version only (H3 / Kling 3.0 / Veo 3.1 / Grok Imagine 1.5). They contain no current web-UI or MCP guarantee; verify provider syntax, available mode, and surface at the live model page before a paid run.

## 13. Higgsfield Cinema Studio — ARCHIVE (HF-CS3.5-HIST / HF-CS4-HIST@2026-08): settings table, recipes, platform notes

> **Hard routing stop:** Do **not** use this chapter to name a current Cinema Studio setting, standalone Higgsfield Video setting, or Higgsfield MCP operation. Read `platform-ui-workflows.md` first. The version scope below is historical/contextual only.

> **Version scope:** `HF-CS3.5-HIST / Cinema Studio 3.5 / source date unknown`; selected notes labelled “4.0” below are `HF-CS4-HIST@2026-08` and are superseded for live UI routing by `HF-CS4@2026-09-04` in `platform-ui-workflows.md`.

### Settings reference — historical Cinema Studio 3.5 archive (not a current selector list)
Guiding principle, verbatim: "**The prompt describes what happens. The settings describe the world it happens in.**" Every setting answers a question the model would otherwise answer itself.

| Setting | Options (exact, 3.5 base) |
|---|---|
| Genre | General (neutral) · Action (camera tied to moving subject) · Epic (scale, environments as protagonists) · Drama (camera as witness) · Comedy (air in framing) · Horror (uncomfortable angles, withholding light) · Noir (shadow logic) |
| Color Palette | Auto · Naturalistic Clean · Bleached Warm · Hyper Neon · Teal & Orange Epic · Sodium Decay (thriller anxiety) · Cold Steel (military/noir/sci-fi) · Bleach Bypass (war/gritty) · Classic B&W — 4.0: 50+ palettes |
| Camera MoveSet Style | Auto · Classic Static ("Hitchcock") · Silent Machine ("Fincher") · One Take ("Lubezki") · Epic Scale ("Hoytema"/IMAX) · Intimate Observer ("Sean Baker") · Impossible Camera · Documentary Snap · Raw Chaos ("Greengrass") · Dreamy Flow ("Doyle") |
| Lighting | Auto · Soft Cross (90° side, half face in shadow) · Overhead Fall (crown-lit, eyes shadowed — temples, high rooms) · Contre-jour (backlit halo — sunsets, romance) · Window · Practicals (ONLY in-frame sources, no hidden fill — candles, explosions, headlights) · Silhouette |
| Camera | Raw 16mm (real stock grain) · Fine Film (35mm warmth) · Clean Digital |
| Lens | Auto · Clinical Sharp · Extreme Macro · Anamorphic (oval bokeh, horizontal flares) · Warm Halation · Vintage Haze |
| Focal Length | 8 · 14 · 35 · 50 · 75 mm |
| Aperture | f/1.4 Wide Open · f/4 Moderate · f/11 Deep Focus |
| 4.0 additions | Era (decade selector: grain/grade/lens auto-adjust) · Tempo (Chaotic/Dynamic/Calm/Single Shot) · Emotion Wheel (8+ types incl. anger, joy, fear, trust — per @character tag; ⚠️ full type list not published) |

🟢 **Preset choice is causal, not aesthetic:** the wrong lighting preset feeds the model wrong world information (lavender field + Overhead Fall = parking-lot look; candle scene + Soft Cross = hidden fill destroys the atmosphere). Practicals for any scene whose light lives IN frame.
🟡 HF-CS3.5-HIST recipes — option names are 3.5 labels that do NOT exist as 4.0 selectors; use only as a mood-to-dial mapping idea, re-select each value from the HF-CS4 table in platform-ui-workflows §1: war = Action + Bleach Bypass + Raw Chaos + Practicals + Fine Film + Clinical Sharp 14mm f/4 · rally chase = Action + Cold Steel + Raw Chaos + Practicals + Fine Film + Anamorphic 14mm f/4 · epic fantasy = Epic + Teal & Orange Epic + Epic Scale + Contre-jour + Fine Film + Anamorphic 35mm f/4. FAQ rules: portrait → 50/75 mm; landscape → f/11.

### Historical CS 4.0 platform notes (August 2026; superseded for live UI routing)
**Do not copy settings, limits, or model availability from this subsection into a current recommendation.** It remains only as dated production evidence; the current verified UI/MCP record is `platform-ui-workflows.md` → `HF-CS4@2026-09-04` / `HF-WEB@2026-09-04` / `HF-MCP@2026-09-04`.
🟢 **Multi-model support** — engine chosen PER SHOT (Seedance et al. run natively; UI reports also name Higgsfield Native, Kling, Veo) — the ch.-11 selection matrix maps directly onto the UI. **Montage Pacing** ("cuts, rhythm and flow built in — no timeline, no post"). **Personal Assistant** (canonical name in this skill; historically "Mr. Higgs", the 3.5 docs' "Claude Chat", "AI Director" in tester videos): picks camera/light, writes prompts with real @tags, breaks scripts into shots — never triggers Generate itself. **Subfoldering** (scenes/versions/deliverables for 200-shot productions), **Canvas**, team layer (live co-directing, shared elements), **Color Grading** as a fine-tune pass. Credits by length × resolution × model. **Blender plugin (free) [P18]:** Bridge connector (`HF-BRIDGE-MCP@2026-09-04`) links the LLM to Blender for 3D blockouts; a Higgsfield panel inside Blender drops assets/models/scenes — the blocking-first path of production-pipeline ch. 8.
🟢 Specs — resolution is a MOVING TARGET, documented states: launch blog (Aug 2026) said up to 30 s / max 720p; **platform update later in Aug 2026: Seedance 2.5 inside Higgsfield now renders 1080p**; the product page additionally claims native 4K and up to one minute (partly unverified). Since Seedance 2.5 is technically 4K-capable, a later 2K/4K unlock on Higgsfield is plausible — the cap is a platform resource/cost decision, not a model limit. 🟡 Agents: **web-verify the current resolution tier before planning any resolution pipeline.** Constant: up to 50 references, forward/**backward** extend, 30+ camera presets. The verified native-4K route today remains Seedance 2.0 direct (`seedance_2_0, 21:9, 4k`).
🟢 **Seedance 2.5 edit/extension surface on Higgsfield (Aug 2026) [H-off/X-ext]:** four modes behind one model — `t2v` · `omni_reference` · `video_edit` · `video_extension` (mode id ↔ UI label table: platform-ui-workflows §1) — plus UI features Region edit, Shot re-generate, Draw to Video, Extend/Transition/Reverse. 🟢 **In the composer UI, `video_edit` surfaces as its own model entry "Seedance 2.5 Edit" [PP]:** video-model selector → "Seedance 2.5 Edit", task dropdown "Edit video", source clip into the **VIDEO TO EDIT** slot, references addressed via @-elements as usual, up to 1080p — sessions should name it exactly like this when guiding the user. **No mask/annotation editor on the Video page as of 2026-08-31** (Dreamina has Smart Edit; 🟡 a draw-over tool was sighted in Cinema Studio Edit → Advanced on 2026-09-01) — edit regions are described in words. **Edits bill the source's full duration** (a 20-s master costs a 20-s render however small the edit) — savings come from fewer attempts, not cheaper runs. Native **1080p since 2026-08-14** (Plus+ plans); 4K on 2.5 was an upscale as of HF-WEB@2026-09-04 (FLUX 3 Video Upscaler keeps audio in sync); native 4K was documented only on the Seedance 2.0 lane at that date — both superseded by the live output dropdown (platform-ui-workflows.md output-configuration rule). **Soul ID** carries a trained identity across ALL platform models ("generate with Seedance 2.5, switch models, same character holds"); AI Cast / Element Sharing / Canvas make the reference pool team-shared. Workflow doctrine: video-prompting ch. 14b.
🔴 Marketing claims, test yourself: "anti-slop camera pipeline" (no plastic skin, no drifting faces, no AI shimmer) and AI-Cast/location persistence ("same street, same weather, next week") — advertising only; validate against the proven drift rules (production-pipeline ch. 3/6).

## 13b. Cinema Studio / Seedance prompt patterns — version-independent, live doctrine [H-off/PP]
> These rules do not depend on the Cinema Studio version. They are cited as current by production-pipeline, style-control, renderability, post-audio-legal, director-recipes, production-bible, pixar-look and workflows. Current selector names still come only from platform-ui-workflows §1.

🟢 **Dials before prompt:** camera, optics/aperture, light, color, tempo go into SETTINGS; the prompt carries scene, action, reference roles, timeline, continuity. Avoid double control (settings AND prompt text) — conflicts. ⚠️ Unless the per-project A/B shows a control does not bite on the chosen video model — then that aspect moves into its ch. 12 block and leaves the setting on Auto (platform-ui-workflows §1, blockquote "Do the controls bite?", Aug/Sep 2026).
🟢 **Settings are VIDEO controls, not still controls [PP]:** the CS settings panel (Genre, Palette, Lighting, Camera, Era, Tempo…) applies at video generation. Still prompts in the stills-first phase do NOT reference these settings — the still carries its look entirely in prompt + references; the settings become relevant at the motion test. Keep the two control layers strictly separate in any prompt document.
🟢 **Style anchor duty for stylized looks:** CS and Seedance default to photorealism; Pixar/cartoon/anime must be anchored actively — look-carrying references AND/OR an explicit style anchor; weak anchoring tips into photorealism (full mechanics: style-control).



<!-- NGV entry: platforms-models-a0954cd3380a; source lines 54-63; contract: dialects -->
### Official prompt patterns (from published production prompts)
🟢 DoP names as legal style references ("References in spirit, fully original execution: Deakins, Hoytema…") · ABSOLUTE ANTI-IP block as a standard section (generic settings, no insignia/logos, original score, "all on-screen text in POST") · percentage color distribution (60/30/10) · keyframe placeable mid-sequence ("Reproduce the KEYFRAME composition EXACTLY at Shot 3 — BUT his action is changed: …") · CRITICAL handling blocks for standing invariants ("ALWAYS by the HANDLE, NEVER on the blade") — in the ch. 12 structure these sit in POSITIVE LOCKS, not as a block of their own.
🟢 **Multi-plate set for dialogue:** @room1 master + @room2 reverse + @room3 detail — "three angles of ONE set at ONE shared exposure"; the axis (180° line) named in every prompt.
🟢 **Master-screen trick** for locked in-frame text: freeze the text in the reference plate, lock via prompt ("exactly this one line, frozen and identical in every frame") — the plate-locked exception of the unified text rule (renderability §2).
🟢 **Locked prompt template of the official prompt-builder skill** (`/higgsfield-seedance-prompt`): scene context → references → shot-by-shot action → lighting → locks; audio always real-world sound only, music added in the edit. Invocation is a natural-language scene brief with @tags ("@hero is searching @loc_cabin … finds @map_prop …") — the skill expands it into the full schema. One prompt covers a whole beat: cuts, dialogue line, and sound from a single generation. [H-off Stage 3]
🟢 **Named elements include anchors [PP]:** create characters, locations, props AND approved shot anchors as named elements (production-pipeline ch. 1, `@anchor_1A` convention); the @tag brief then addresses the anchor directly ("@anchor_1A carries look, geometry and blocking" — as reference; "start from @anchor_1A" only when chaining onto an existing clip, production-pipeline ch. 1) — no manual upload per generation, no wrong-image mistakes as the anchor library grows.
🟢 **Official zero-motion / rack-focus block** (copy-ready camera language): "The camera stays planted in one immovable position from the first frame to the last. Zero motion — no drift, no shake, no breathing, no stabilization float, no micro-drift. Hold sharp on [plane A — the far anchor]; then rack once to [plane B — the near subject]; then follow focus on the subject if they move toward the lens. The rack is slow, smooth and continuous with no hunting and no overshoot; the follow focus tracks without breathing." — the pattern for static dialogue/tension shots. [H-off Academy]
🟢 **BEAT structure** for takes: numbered beats with time ranges, one primary event each.
🟢 Negations of both kinds are official CS practice — governed by the revised negative rule in video-prompting ch. 14.

## 21. Cross-model syntax profiles: MiniMax H3, Kling 3.0, Veo 3.1, Grok Imagine

> **Version scope:** `MODEL-PROFILE-H3@official-guides-2026-09-02`, `MODEL-PROFILE-KLING-3.0@unversioned-source`, `MODEL-PROFILE-VEO-3.1@unversioned-source`, and `MODEL-PROFILE-GROK-IMAGINE-1.5@unversioned-source`. These are prompt-language profiles, not platform UI/MCP instructions. Record a current provider/aggregator surface, mode, endpoint/model identifier, source URL and check date before using any profile in production.
For shots routed to a non-Seedance model via the ch.-11/renderability matrix. Never port prompts 1:1 (style-control §5b). **Source status (2026-09-02):** the H3 profile below is rebuilt on MiniMax's OFFICIAL prompt-writing guides (`MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-H3/skills/h3-prompt-writing/references/base-en.txt` + `ref-en.txt`, tag [MM-off]) plus hosted-surface snapshots; the earlier single-guide syntax is retired where it conflicted. Version scope: `MODEL-PROFILE-H3@official-guides-2026-09-02`. Spine order and per-model adaptation notes for Kling/Veo/Grok live in video-prompting 12g; the instances below are written in that order and are the copy-ready form — when ch. 12 block order and 12g disagree, 12g wins for these models.

### MiniMax H3 (Hailuo 3) — full syntax profile
🟢 Specs: 4–15 s (15 s / 24 fps hard cap), 32-kHz stereo audio native; ratios 21:9 … 9:16 (+ Auto in reference mode). **Resolution ⚠️ source conflict:** an engineering guide described 768p base + a separate "H3-Regenerate-2K" re-feed module; hosted surfaces (fal, Hailuo, OpenArt, MiniMax Design) expose **native 2K = 1440-px short edge** with 768p "coming soon" on fal (snapshot 2026-08-02, [P42]) — treat 2K as native on hosted surfaces, local builds set resolution by megapixels and hold identity worse when quantized ([P46]). **One beat per shot** — a second action = a second shot. H3 runs an internal LLM rewrite: sloppy prompts still work, but a fixed structure is what lets you iterate per axis (SKILL rule 14). [MM-off, P42–P46]
🟢 6-layer formula: Subject (specific!) + Action (active verbs with direction/speed) + Scene + Visual Style (ONE, committed) + Camera (one move) + **Audio (never omit — otherwise random ambience)**.
🟢 **Base-mode prompt (T2VA / I2VA / FL2VA / L2VA) — three fixed fields, blank-line separated [MM-off]:**
```
integrated_multimodal_description: [Shot 1] Live-action, cinematic, a medium-wide shot frames …
[Shot 2] At 00:03.500, the camera cuts to …

overall_soundscape: 1–4 sentences — ambience + physical + non-verbal human sound (N/A only for total silence)

non_diegetic_music: instrumentation / tempo / dynamics — or N/A
```
Timestamps are **cut points, not ranges**: `[Shot N] At MM:SS.mmm,` — Shot 1 carries no timestamp, later ones strictly increasing inside the duration. Cut verbs are fixed: "the camera cuts to / the shot cuts to / transitions to / changes to / switches to"; dissolve, fade, wipe only when the director explicitly asks. A cut must add new information — a mere distance change is a camera move, not a cut. `non_diegetic_music: N/A` is the official no-score switch (SKILL rule 9 in syntax). ⚠️ Retires the earlier `MM:SS.mmm–MM:SS.mmm` range form; ranges like `[0-2s]:` still run through the LLM rewrite [P46] but are not the documented channel. Shot budget still holds as guidance: 4–6 s → 1–2 shots · 7–10 s → 2–3 · 11–15 s → 3–5, with a 6-shot/15-s pass reported [P43]; shots 2–5 s, never <1.5 s; fast-motion shots ≤2 s or faces drift [P43].
🟢 **Camera vocabulary (exact terms, written as prose inside the shot) [MM-off]:** Zoom In/Out · Push In / Pull Out · Pan Left/Right · Truck Left/Right · Tilt Up/Down · Pedestal Up/Down · Arc Shot · Tracking Shot · Static Shot · Shake Slightly/Strongly · POV · Roll CW/CCW — with modifiers "with small/large amplitude", "at slow/fast speed" ("The camera pushes in with small amplitude at slow speed toward …").
🟢 **Dialogue [MM-off]:** `<d>[English] line text</d>` inline in the shot — only the language tag and the verbatim line inside; speaker identity and delivery OUTSIDE the tag, with stable speaker IDs `(S1)`, `(S2)`, compound `(S1,S2)` across shots. Voice-over: the exact phrase "says in an off-screen voiceover" followed by "while his lips remain completely closed". `<scenetrans>` on both sides of a line that crosses a cut; `<cutoff>` for speech truncated by the video's end. Max 1–2 sentences per shot. 🟡 Voice quality: a voice REFERENCE reached high similarity in one test [P43] — test before defaulting to external VO replacement (post-audio-legal ch. 18).
🟡 **Speaker disambiguation [P33]:** prefix every line with a visible descriptor, not just a name — "Nicole, the girl wearing pink shoes: …" — or the line is spoken by the wrong character (documented failure in a multi-character kids' story).
🟢 **On-screen text has an official channel [MM-off]:** visible text in double quotes, verbatim, untranslated (`a neon sign reading "营业中"`) — the syntax is documented; result quality stays practitioner-rated (renderability §2 exception b).
🟢 **Modes [MM-off]:** **T2VA** (describe everything) · **I2VA** — first line verbatim `For the target video, at 0.00 seconds into the target video, <Picture 1> (from [Shot 1]) is fully referenced.`; then anchor the image's style/subjects/composition briefly and develop (anchor → onset → development → result) — not "never re-describe", but never re-describe at length · **FL2VA / L2VA** — `How the reference pictures align with the target video — Picture 1 (from Shot 1) aligns with the 0.00-second mark; Picture 2 (from Shot N) aligns with the S.SS-second mark`; FL2VA favours a single shot; **L2VA (last-frame mode) generates the events BEFORE the image** (a poster assembling from blank, [P46]) · **Ref2VA** (full-reference / "omni") — reference steers subject, style, motion, audio; the scene is NEW.
🟢 **Ref2VA prompt — six sections, fixed order [MM-off]:** `subject_definitions` / `summary` / `retention_analysis` / `detailed_description` / `overall_soundscape` / `non_diegetic_music`. Labels: `<Subject N>` = reusable visible content, may COMBINE assets ("appearance from <Picture 1>, walking motion from <Video 1>") · `<Picture N>` only when the image is a literal frame/storyboard anchor · `<Video N>` = edit source / continuation / temporal structure · `<Audio N>`; Video and Audio numbered independently, upload order = index on every surface (fal writes `Image1 Video1 Audio1`, Hailuo UI `@Image 1`, ComfyUI `<Picture 1>`). `summary` opens with a task prefix: `[reference generation]`, `[video editing + audio reuse]`, `keyframe completion`, `video continuation`, `audio reference`. Retention markers are fixed strings — visual `fully_preserved / partially_preserved / attribute_transfer / weak_reference`, audio `fully_copy / partially_copy / reference / weak_reference` — the machine-readable form of SKILL rule 5 (attach → address, job + exclusions; `@tag` ↔ `<Subject N>`). Style in 1–2 sentences BEFORE `[Shot 1]`; target 350–500 words. Two audio roles in practice [P42]: voice clone (`reference`: timbre only, line written in the prompt) vs seed audio (`fully_copy`: "Audio 1 is Matt's line and this is what he says" — the model transcribes it).
```
subject_definitions: <Subject 1> = the courier (appearance from <Picture 1>, walking motion from <Video 1>) …
summary: [reference generation] One sentence of what the target video is.
retention_analysis: <Subject 1> fully_preserved; <Picture 2> attribute_transfer (palette only); <Audio 1> reference
detailed_description: Style in 1–2 sentences. [Shot 1] … [Shot 2] At 00:04.000, the camera cuts to …
overall_soundscape: …
non_diegetic_music: N/A
```
Field names, `<…>` labels, retention strings and `[Shot N] At MM:SS.mmm,` are verbatim tokens; the bracketed task prefix in `summary` is written exactly as listed (bracketed forms with brackets, bare forms bare).
🟢 **Reference budgets (hosted Omni, snapshot 2026-08-02 [P42]; ComfyUI node [P46]):** 9 images + 3 videos + 3 audio, **12 files max**; video/audio pools 15 s each, clips 2–15 s; audio needs ≥1 image/video; images 256–5760 px. Prompt cap ≈7,000 chars raw model; 🟡 **≈2,000 on the fal form** (snapshot 2026-08-02, condense). Don't re-describe a reference — declare its job ("Image 1 defines Matt") and use the bare name; video refs: "use for motion and timing, don't copy people or location"; "when the reference is accurate, say 'strictly refer to Video 1' and stop describing".
🟡 **Failure modes and fixes (hosted tests [P43], local V2V [P44]):** an unlocked prop (a rifle) appeared → lock prop ownership explicitly ("no duplicate props; only @hero holds the …") · filtered violent action → choreography verbs, not outcome verbs ("engages", not "kills") · assigned per-zone actions collapse → over the per-shot action ceiling, split generations · plastic product → surface imperfection + one hard key · crowds: background figures morph/vanish, hero identity inside the crowd held (renderability §2) · motion transfer survives a prompted camera-angle change · a low-training-data prop could not be oriented toward the character → separate close-up refs, not a collage · V2V: motion not fully mimicked, longer clips drift from the reference motion, unrequested beats appear (SKILL rule 13 canon risk).
🟢 **Local / ComfyUI [P44, P46]:** weights split FL2VA family (T2V + I2V) vs Ref2VA; VRAM tiers BF16 66 GB · pruned BF16 >32 GB · INT8 ≥24 GB · pruned INT8 12 GB with offload · FP8 for RTX 40/50; Ref2VA node 12 media inputs max; V2V is prompt-driven — DWPose OR Depth Anything V2 alone suffices (bypass one); transparent-background PNG character refs accepted (🟡 "more accurate"); text-only additive VFX (fire, snow, faster push-in) with no masks, clean edges; LoRA training for style/character/motion lock (style-control §5b, method still unshown 🟡).
🟢 Don'ts (official + tested): transitions other than cuts unless asked · slideshow prompts (each shot needs continuous motion) · FPS/frame counts · meta words ("high quality", "viral") · overlapping or decreasing timestamps · mapping labels written INTO reference images. Unique strengths: 2D line quality, comparatively stable UI/text 🟡, identity mapping per image.

### Kling 3.0 — compact profile
🟢 Strengths: multi-shot storytelling (holds art style across shots), directed movement, elements/reference system, native audio (CN/EN/JP/KR/ES + accents), MotionControl (reference action video + face binding). **Spine (binding, from video-prompting 12g): Camera → Scene → Subject+Action (ONE subject, ONE action, motion endpoint) → Vibe/Lighting → Time/Audio.** Camera opens the prompt; composition comes from the input image when one is attached. **Repeat the identical subject descriptor, the style keywords and the style reference image in EVERY prompt of a sequence** (each generation is interpreted independently — drifts otherwise). Anime: 5–8 s, 2–3× reroll budget, never mix realism + anime. Exclusions go in Kling's negative field as bare keywords, most critical first (image-model-logic ch. 24f), never as "no …" sentences in the prompt body. No block headers, no @tags in the body — plain prose in this order. Element budget: unverified for 3.0 here — read the live Elements panel limit and record it in the receipt (video-prompting 12g).
**Copy-ready instance (T2V, 6 s):**
```
Slow dolly push forward, 47° neutral lens, camera at chest height. A rain-slick alley at night, one sodium lamp overhead, wet brick walls left and right. A woman with short black hair, a silver streak at the left temple, in a grey wool coat turns from the wall and walks toward the lamp, then settles into a stop directly under it. Hard top light, cold blue fill from the street behind her, wet reflections on the ground. 6 s, real time; audio: rain on metal, her heels on wet stone, no music.
```
Negative field: `subtitles, text, extra people, blur`
(Sequence rule: shot 5 of the same sequence repeats "A woman with short black hair, a silver streak at the left temple, in a grey wool coat" word for word.)


<!-- NGV entry: platforms-models-195226cac8fa; source lines 111-118; contract: dialects -->
### Veo 3.1 — compact profile
🟢 Strengths: polished cinematic realism, natural environments, integrated audiovisual, ingredients (references), first/last frames, scene extension, camera controls. **Spine (binding, from video-prompting 12g — Google's five-part formula): Cinematography → Subject → Action → Context → Style & Ambiance, then one Audio line.** Descriptive natural language, no block headers, no bracketed Seedance audio syntax. Multi-shot in one clip via range timestamps `[00:00–00:03] … [00:03–00:06] …`. Request continuity explicitly ("consistent wardrobe, props, positions", "keep character on-model across shots"). Camera phrasing: "lateral tracking shot, camera moves with subject" / "camera cranes upward". Physics-correct motion fights stylized looks — prompt the motion grammar along (style-control §5b). Exclusions: Veo's negative field, bare keywords, most critical first (image-model-logic ch. 24f).
**Copy-ready instance (T2V, 6 s, two shots):**
```
[00:00–00:03] Lateral tracking shot, camera moves with the subject at chest height, 47° neutral lens. A woman with short black hair, a silver streak at the left temple, in a grey wool coat walks along a rain-slick night alley toward a single sodium lamp. Wet brick walls, hard top light, cold blue fill from the street behind her. [00:03–00:06] Reverse shot, static, medium close-up: she stops under the lamp and looks up into the light, breath visible. Consistent wardrobe, hair and lighting across both shots; keep character on-model. Cinematic photoreal, shallow depth of field, fine film grain. Audio: steady rain on metal, her heels on wet stone, no music.
```
Negative field: `subtitles, text, extra people, lens flare`

### Grok Imagine (1.5) — compact profile
🟢 Fast iteration, native audio, strong instruction-following for movement/pacing/transitions; native stylization bias (cartoon/anime/art-directed). **Spine (binding, from video-prompting 12g): Style qualifier FIRST → Subject → Action → Camera → Scene → Style detail → Sound → ONE stability constraint.** Negatives unreliable → phrase every exclusion as the wanted state, no negative field. Strong I2V: when the source still already carries the look, use the short verb-led form and let the image carry aesthetics. Grok Imagine 1.5: 1080p only in specific modes (mode names unverified — read the live selector), 720p otherwise; plan the upscale path unless the receipt shows 1080p. Use for stylized shots, mood/concept tests, fast exploration.
**Copy-ready instance (T2V, 6 s):**
```
Painterly anime, cel-shaded, flat colour. A woman with short black hair, a silver streak at the left temple, in a grey wool coat walks toward a sodium lamp and stops under it. Slow push-in, camera at chest height. A rain-slick night alley, wet brick walls, one lamp overhead. Hard top light, cold blue fill, visible rain streaks. Sound: rain on metal, her heels, no music. Keep her face and coat identical from first to last frame.

```
She blinks slowly, then looks up into the lamp. Slow push-in. Rain continues.
